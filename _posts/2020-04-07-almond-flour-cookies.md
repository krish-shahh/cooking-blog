## Ingredients:

* 1 cup (112 g) blanched almond flour (not almond meal)
* 3 tablespoons coconut sugar (see notes for keto, & other, options)
* 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
* 2 tablespoons water
* Optional: 1/8 teaspoon fine sea salt

## Instructions:

1. Preheat the oven to 350F (175C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
2. In a medium bowl, whisk the almond flour, coconut sugar, baking powder and (optional) salt (breaking up all lumps in the flour). Add the water and stir until blended. (Add any toppings here like chocoplate chips, raisins, cinammon, etc)
3. Drop by scant tablespoons (I use a small cookie scoop, which is just shy of a tablespoon) on the prepared baking sheet, spacing 2 inches apart.
4. Bake in the preheated oven for 13 to 16 minutes until golden brown and set at the centers.
5. Remove from the oven and cool for 10 minutes on the baking sheet. Transfer cookies to a cooling rack and cool completely.
